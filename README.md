# Mulearn Campus Chapter - README

Welcome to the Mulearn Campus Chapter! In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to implement your changes to the data.json file of the Mulearn Campus Chapter GitHub repository. Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the Mulearn Campus Chapter repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/campus-chapter](https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/campus-chapter)

2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Edit the data.json File

1. Once you have forked the repository, go to your forked repository on GitHub.

2. Navigate to the `data.json` file in your repository. You can find it in the root directory.

3. Click on the "Edit" button (pencil icon) to make changes to the `data.json` file.

## Step 3: Customize Your College Information

Now, it's time to update the `data.json` file with your college's information. Replace the sample data with your own:

- Update the `"collegeCode"` with your college's code.
- Replace `"college"` with your college's name.
- Modify the `"about"` section with a brief description of your college.
- Update the list of `"events"` with your own events, including the event date, name, description, and image URL.
- Customize the `"gallery"` section with images that represent your college.
- Adjust the `"statistics"` section with relevant statistics about your college.
- Update the `"team"` section with the names and images of your team members.
- If you have social media or contact information, add them under their respective fields (e.g., `"discordLink"`, `"whatsAppLink"`, `"email"`, `"linkedIn"`, `"instagram"`, `"twitter"`, `"facebook"`).
- example:- If your collegeCode is MBT,  Then change`"collegeCode": "SNT"` into `"collegeCode": "MBT"`

Remember to keep the JSON format intact while making these changes.

## Step 4: Host Your Repository

To make your changes live and accessible on the web, you can host your repository using services like Vercel or Netlify. Here's a basic guide:

- **Netlify Hosting**:
  - Watch this video tutorial on how to deploy a GitHub repository to Netlify:  [Netlify Deployment Tutorial](https://youtu.be/4h8B080Mv4U?feature=shared).

- **Vercel Hosting**:
  - Visit [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.
  - Connect your GitHub account to Vercel.
  - Create a new site and select your forked repository.
  - Configure the build settings (usually, the default settings work fine).
  - Deploy your site.

Once your site is deployed, you'll receive a URL where your Mulearn Campus Chapter page can be accessed.

## Step 5: Share and Collaborate

You're all set! Share the link to your Mulearn Campus Chapter page with your college community and start collaborating on this project. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask moderators in the Mulearn Discord server.
